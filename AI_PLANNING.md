# AI Planning Phase

## Prompt used with AI (ChatGPT Model)

> "Act as a UI/UX expert. I need to design an admin dashboard for 'Luna Store', an e-commerce platform.
> Please suggest:
> 1. A clean, modern Layout structure (Sidebar vs Topbar).
> 2. A color palette that fits the name 'Luna' (moon/night themes) but remains professional for business.
> 3. Key metrics to show in the top cards.
> 4. How to visualize sales data simply without clutter."

## AI Suggestion Summary

**Layout:**
*   **Sidebar:** Left-aligned, collapsible on mobile. Dark background to anchor the view.
*   **Main Content:** Light gray background (Card style UI).
*   **Navigation:** Dashboard, Orders, Inventory, Users, Settings.

**Colors:**
*   Primary: Deep Indigo/Midnight Blue (#1e1b4b) for the sidebar.
*   Accent: Soft Purple (#818cf8) or Electric Blue.
*   Background: Slate-50 for reduced eye strain.
*   Cards: Pure White with subtle drop shadows.

**Metrics:**
*   Total Revenue (with % growth).
*   Active Orders.
*   New Customers.
*   Low Stock Alerts (Crucial for e-commerce).

## My Refinements

1.  **Search Placement:** The AI suggested search in the sidebar. I moved it to the **Top Bar** to make it accessible globally and keep the sidebar navigation clean.
2.  **Chart Complexity:** AI suggested a dual-line chart (Revenue vs Profit). I simplified this to a **Single Bar Chart** for "Sales Overview" to match the user's request for simplicity and mobile readability.
3.  **Visual Hierarchy:** I added specific color-coding for Order Statuses (Green/Delivered, Yellow/Pending) in the table to make it scanable at a glance, which wasn't explicitly detailed in the AI text response.
